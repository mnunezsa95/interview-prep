Your task is to add a new property usersAnswer to every object in the array questions. The value of usersAnswer should be set to null. The solution should work for array of any length.

For example:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's Pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0
}];

*/

var questions = [
  {
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0,
  },
  {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0,
  },
];

questions.map((obj) => (obj.usersAnswer = null));

console.log(questions[0].usersAnswer === null);
